# 🎥 IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model classifies reviews as either positive or negative.

## 📚 Project Overview

The IMDB Sentiment Analysis project aims to:
- 🧹 Preprocess movie reviews by cleaning and normalizing text data.
- 🛠️ Extract meaningful features from the text using TF-IDF vectorization.
- 🧠 Train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the sentiment of reviews.
- 📊 Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and visualize the results.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the IMDB Dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- 🐼 pandas
- 📊 matplotlib
- 🎨 seaborn
- 🔢 numpy
- 🤖 scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn
```
